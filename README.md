Phoneticizer: Convert Text to Phonetic Alphabet in Python



Overview



The Phoneticizer is a Python program designed to convert a given input text into its corresponding phonetic alphabet representation. This tool is particularly handy for scenarios where information needs to be communicated over voice channels, such as spelling out names, messages, or alphanumeric codes.



Features



Converts letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and spaces to their respective phonetic equivalents.

Maintains the original spacing in the input text.

Case-insensitive: Converts all characters to uppercase for consistent mapping.




Run the program using Python.

Enter the desired text when prompted.

The program will output the phonetic representation of the input text.

Phonetic Mapping

The program uses a dictionary, phonetic_alphabet, to map each character to its phonetic equivalent. The dictionary includes entries for all 26 letters of the alphabet, numbers 0-9, and a space character.

Feel free to customize the phonetic_alphabet dictionary to add additional mappings or modify existing ones based on your preferences.
